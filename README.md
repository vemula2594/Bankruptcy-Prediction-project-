# Bankruptcy-Prediction-project-
This project involves building a classification model to predict the probability of bankruptcy for a business based on various features. The dataset contains information on 250 companies and 7 features, and the goal is to predict the target variable, "bankruptcy" or "non-bankruptcy". The project aims to help businesses and investors make informed decisions about investing in a particular company

Business Objective:

The objective of this project is to predict the probability of bankruptcy for a business based on various features. The project involves a binary classification problem where the target variable is "bankruptcy" or "non-bankruptcy". The dataset contains information on 250 companies and 7 features that can help in predicting the probability of bankruptcy.


Dataset:
The dataset contains the following variables:

industrial_risk: A risk score indicating the level of risk associated with the industry of the business. It can take on the values 0 (low risk), 0.5 (medium risk), or 1 (high risk).
management_risk: A risk score indicating the level of risk associated with the management of the business. It can take on the values 0 (low risk), 0.5 (medium risk), or 1 (high risk).
financial flexibility: A score indicating the level of financial flexibility of the business. It can take on the values 0 (low flexibility), 0.5 (medium flexibility), or 1 (high flexibility).
credibility: A score indicating the level of credibility of the business. It can take on the values 0 (low credibility), 0.5 (medium credibility), or 1 (high credibility).
competitiveness: A score indicating the level of competitiveness of the business. It can take on the values 0 (low competitiveness), 0.5 (medium competitiveness), or 1 (high competitiveness).
operating_risk: A risk score indicating the level of operating risk associated with the business. It can take on the values 0 (low risk), 0.5 (medium risk), or 1 (high risk).
class: The target variable indicating whether the business went bankrupt or not.


Approach:
The project involves building a classification model to predict the probability of bankruptcy based on the given features. Various classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines can be used for this purpose. The performance of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


Conclusion:
Predicting the probability of bankruptcy can help businesses and investors make informed decisions about investing in a particular company. By using the given features, a classification model can be built to predict the probability of bankruptcy. The model's performance can be evaluated using various metrics, and the best model can be selected for deployment.
